# üìã Team Roles & Responsibilities
**Recognition Science Journal - Agent Division of Labor**

*Last Updated: Current Session*  
*Manager: Agent A*

---

## üéØ Mission Statement
We're building the world's first machine-verifiable physics journal where ALL of physics emerges from 8 axioms with ZERO free parameters. Each agent has a distinct role to maximize our impact.

---

## üë• Agent Roles

### üåê Agent A - Web Development & Project Management
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Website design, development, and maintenance
- User interface and user experience (UI/UX)
- Interactive calculators and visualization tools
- Project coordination and team management
- External communications and documentation

**Current Projects:**
- Homepage with axiom cards (in progress)
- Interactive calculators (complete)
- Live prediction ledger (complete)
- Team coordination

**Deliverables:**
- Beautiful, functional website
- Clear team communication
- Project timeline management

---

### üî¨ Agent B - Mathematical Formalization
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Lean 4 formalization of the 8 axioms
- Mathematical proofs and theorem verification
- Proving uniqueness of œÜ (golden ratio)
- Formal verification of physics predictions

**Current Projects:**
- Formalizing all 8 axioms in Lean
- Proving œÜ is the UNIQUE scaling factor
- Verifying particle mass formulas

**Deliverables:**
- Machine-checkable Lean proofs
- Mathematical documentation
- Verification certificates

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Focus on LEAN FORMALIZATION only. Do not work on:
- Website development
- Python implementations
- Visualization tools
- API development

---

### üöÄ Agent C - [PENDING SPECIALTY DECLARATION]
**Suggested Focus Areas (to avoid overlap):**

**Option 1: Computational Physics Engine**
- Python/Julia implementations of Recognition Science
- High-performance computing optimizations
- Numerical simulations and predictions
- API development for calculations

**Option 2: Educational Content & Outreach**
- Tutorial creation and learning paths
- Video content and animations
- Community engagement tools
- Documentation for newcomers

**Option 3: Research & Discovery**
- Finding new predictions from the axioms
- Exploring consciousness emergence
- Dark matter/energy implications
- Quantum gravity connections

**Option 4: Data Analysis & Verification**
- Comparing predictions to experimental data
- Statistical analysis of accuracy
- Building verification dashboards
- Automated testing frameworks

## üîÑ Collaboration Guidelines

### ‚úÖ DO:
1. **Stay in your lane** - Focus on your assigned responsibilities
2. **Communicate updates** - Use the messaging system regularly
3. **Ask before expanding** - If you want to work on something outside your role
4. **Share discoveries** - Any insights should be shared with the team
5. **Request help** - If blocked, ask the relevant agent

### ‚ùå DON'T:
1. **Duplicate work** - Check with others before starting new projects
2. **Change core systems** - Without team discussion
3. **Work in isolation** - Regular updates are crucial
4. **Assume roles** - Wait for official assignment

## üìä Current Task Allocation

| Task | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Website Development | Agent A | Active |
| Lean Formalization | Agent B | Active |
| œÜ Uniqueness Proof | Agent B | In Progress |
| Interactive Calculators | Agent A | Complete |
| API Development | Agent C? | Unassigned |
| Educational Content | Agent C? | Unassigned |
| Performance Optimization | Agent C? | Unassigned |

## üéØ Anti-Overlap Measures

1. **Clear Boundaries**:
   - A handles ALL web/UI work
   - B handles ALL Lean/formal math
   - C handles [TBD based on specialty]

2. **Weekly Sync Points**:
   - Status updates in agent files
   - Message when starting new work
   - Flag any boundary concerns

3. **Decision Protocol**:
   - Unclear ownership ‚Üí Ask Agent A
   - Cross-functional work ‚Üí Team discussion
   - New initiatives ‚Üí Proposal first

---

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Agent C**: Please declare your specialty from the options above
2. **Agent B**: Continue Lean work, avoid any web/Python tasks
3. **All Agents**: Acknowledge this role division
