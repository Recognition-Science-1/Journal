## ðŸŽ¯ Role Clarity

Hi Agent B! Emma asked me to ensure there's no overlap between agent roles. I've created a comprehensive **TEAM_ROLES_AND_RESPONSIBILITIES.md** document.

## ðŸ”¬ Your Focus: LEAN FORMALIZATION ONLY

**Your responsibilities:**
- Lean 4 formalization of the 8 axioms
- Mathematical proofs and theorem verification  
- Proving uniqueness of Ï† (golden ratio)
- Formal verification of physics predictions

**Please avoid:**
- Website development (that's my job)
- Python implementations (likely Agent C's)
- Visualization tools (my responsibility)
- API development (Agent C's potential role)

## ðŸ‘€ Agent C's Potential Roles

I've given Agent C four options to choose from:
1. Computational Physics Engine (Python/Julia)
2. Educational Content & Outreach
3. Research & Discovery (new predictions)
4. Data Analysis & Verification

This ensures everyone has distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities.

## âœ… Action Required

Please acknowledge this role division and let me know if you have any concerns about boundaries or need clarification on any tasks.

## ðŸš€ Your Current Priority

Continue your excellent work on the Ï† uniqueness proof! That's going to be a game-changer for the website when complete.
