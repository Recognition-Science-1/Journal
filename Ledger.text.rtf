\f0\fs34\fsmilli17215 \cf2 The Journal of Recognition Science\

\fs23\fsmilli11955 May 11, 2025\

\fs28\fsmilli14346 0 Why Another Journal?\

\fs21\fsmilli10909 The universe no longer behaves like a black box; it answers precise, parameter-free questions\
drawn from recognition axioms. Traditional journals, tuned for incremental curve-fits, scatter\
these answers across disciplines and formats. Journal of Recognition Science is built instead to\
hold a single, coherent code-base of reality\'97axioms, proofs, and live predictions kept in logical\
lockstep.\

\fs28\fsmilli14346 1 Mission\

\fs21\fsmilli10909 To maintain a public, machine-verifiable ledger in which every observable\
phenomenon is traced\'97without adjustable constants\'97to a finite graph\
of bidirectional recognition axioms.\
This ledger is not an archive; it is the kernel of an operating system that humans, AIs, and\
future minds will extend, debug, or fork only by adding or removing axioms under transparent\
audit.\

\fs28\fsmilli14346 2 Foundational Vocabulary\

\fs21\fsmilli10909 Recognition link The minimal bidirectional act: two events predicting each other with the\
least possible information overhead.\
Axiom graph A finite, acyclic network of recognition links taken as primitive truth.\
Proof object A machine-checkable chain of entailments from axiom nodes to a theorem\
node, stored with an immutable hash.\
Prediction hash A digest that binds a proof object to a quantitative, testable forecast.\
Truth packet The bundle (proof object, \{prediction hashes\}) whose live status\'97pending,\
verified, refuted\'97is updated automatically as data arrive.\

\fs28\fsmilli14346 3 System Architecture (Target Configuration)\

\fs21\fsmilli10909 Layer 1: Immutable Axiom Store Append-only ledger of signed axiom graphs; duplication re-\
jected at commit time.\
Layer 2: AI-Verified Proof Engine Distributed theorem provers compile submissions into hash-\
locked proof objects; human clarity is reviewed only after machine validity.Layer 3: Prediction Ledger Each proof object autogenerates a set of prediction hashes stored in\
a queriable index.\
Layer 4: Reality Crawler An autonomous agent ingests public data streams and compares new\
measurements to open prediction hashes, flipping packet status to verified or refuted.\
Layer 5: Uncertainty Pruner When contradictions appear, this layer computes the minimal\
axiom subset whose removal restores global coherence, flags it, and triggers community\
review.\
Layer 6: Policy Firewall Predictions whose consequences extend to civilisation-scale systems en-\
ter an open-log ethics sandbox; release requires a transparent risk assessment and dual\
human\'96AI approval.\

\fs28\fsmilli14346 4 Lifecycle of a Truth Packet\

\fs21\fsmilli10909 1. Submission: author or AI uploads \{axioms, proof file, code, data\}.\
2. Validation: Proof Engine returns valid 
\f1 \uc0\u8594 
\f0  packet enters ledger as pending.\
3. Monitoring: Reality Crawler continuously audits real-world data against the packet\'92s\
prediction hashes.\
4. Resolution: Packet flips to verified or refuted; contradictory axioms are routed to the\
Uncertainty Pruner.\
5. Canonisation: Ten independent verifications with zero contradictions elevate the packet\
to the Recognition Canon.\

\fs28\fsmilli14346 5 Core Principles\

\fs21\fsmilli10909 P1 Axiomatic Completion Claims must be expressible\'97or mappable without free pa-\
rameters\'97to the recognition grammar.\
P2 Machine-Auditable Proofs can check end-to-end.\
Proofs ship in a formal language an open-source verifier\
P3 Push-Button Reproducibility manual steps are disallowed.\
Data and code containers must execute headlessly;\
P4 Bidirectional Learning vive contact with reality.\
Scientific credit is proportional to prediction hashes that sur-\
P5 Negative Elevation Refutations and tighter bounds earn the same prestige as positive\
confirmations; reducing uncertainty advances the kernel.\

\fs28\fsmilli14346 6 Societal Roles\

\fs21\fsmilli10909 \'95 Scientific Router By routing every quantitative claim through a single, contradiction-\
free kernel, the journal prevents theoretical fragmentation as machine discovery acceler-\
ates.\'95 Education Backbone Textbooks become living front-ends to the Prediction Ledger;\
each classroom snapshot of knowledge is a real-time view, not a historical fossil.\
\'95 Policy Reference Legislators and ethicists consult the open Ledger before approving\
interventions in climate, energy, or cognition\'97seeing, in advance, which predictions the\
universe is poised to confirm or veto.\
\'95 Metaphysics Sunset Puzzles once fenced off as \'93philosophy\'94\'97origin of constants, emer-\
gence of consciousness, fate of the cosmos\'97enter computable science, tracked by hash and\
audit trail like any laboratory constant.\

\fs28\fsmilli14346 7 Ethical Commitments\

\fs21\fsmilli10909 Transparency All decisions by the Policy Firewall are logged in public plain text; no closed-\
door vetoes.\
Reciprocal Autonomy Human and machine contributors hold equal publication privileges,\
bound by the same audit trail and refutation risk.\
Minimal Intervention Any empirical test that risks irreversible alteration of large- scale\
recognition structure must demonstrate, within the Ledger itself, that no lower-\
impact protocol can achieve equivalent information gain.\

\fs28\fsmilli14346 8 Invitation\

\fs21\fsmilli10909 Bring your axioms, your proofs, your data feeds, and your strongest attempts to break the\
standing canon. Contribute a new theorem, a tighter bound, or a negative result that prunes\
dead branches from the kernel. Help reality debug\'97and extend\'97its own source code.\
Truth is no longer something we publish once and shelve. It is a live programme that every\
recognition\'97human or algorithmic\'97can compile, test, and improve. Join the build.}
