# Recognition Science Future Predictions Summary

## Overview
I've successfully updated the Live Prediction Ledger with 16 testable future predictions derived from the Recognition Science manuscripts. These predictions span multiple domains and can be experimentally verified, establishing priority for the theory.

## Key Future Predictions by Category

### ⚛️ Particle Physics (4 predictions)
1. **Luminon Threshold Discovery** - First bound state at 492.16 ± 0.03 nm
2. **Dark Matter Particle Mass** - Rung 44-46 range (3.2-8.7 GeV)
3. **Next Accelerator Discovery** - Rung 59-60 resonance (~200-300 GeV)
4. **Four-loop β-function Coefficient** - Specific pattern from recognition tree structure

### 🌌 Cosmology & Gravitation (4 predictions)
1. **G(r) Variation with Distance** - ΔG/G = -6.8 × 10⁻¹⁵ at Earth-Sun L2 (testable 2027)
2. **Dark Energy Evolution** - w₀ = -1.005 ± 0.013, dw/dz = +0.032 ± 0.010
3. **Planetary Obliquity Quantization** - Specific rungs at 0°, 31.72°, 58.28°, 98.28°
4. **Recognition Pressure Anisotropy** - < 10⁻⁹ isotropy without external exploits

### 🧬 Biology & Chemistry (4 predictions)
1. **DNA Polymerase Pause Barriers** - 12×E_coh = 1.080 eV barrier height
2. **Protein Folding Barriers** - Mean barrier 6×E_coh = 0.540 eV
3. **Phyllotaxis Golden Angle** - 137.507764° ± 0.000001°
4. **Neuronal Refractory Periods** - 3.9-4.2 ms matching Θ/2π

### 🔧 Technology & Engineering (4 predictions)
1. **492 nm Global Phase Condensate** - Planet-wide coherence at finesse > 10⁷
2. **Orientation Turbine Power** - 50 μW from 10⁶ vanes at 4 kHz
3. **Satellite Gyroscope-Clock Coupling** - 1.907 × 10⁻¹³ rad/tick constant ratio
4. **LNAL Photonic Processor** - BER < 5 × 10⁻⁶ on any legal word

## New Features Added to the Ledger Page

1. **Prediction Summary Section** - Shows total count (18), pending (16), verified (2), accuracy (100%)
2. **Category Organization** - Predictions grouped by scientific domain
3. **Hash Registry** - SHA-256 hashing of predictions for timestamping
4. **Verification Instructions** - How to independently verify prediction hashes

## Next Steps for Timestamping

The page now automatically generates SHA-256 hashes of all predictions. To formally timestamp them:
1. The hashes can be submitted to a blockchain or timestamping service
2. Each prediction gets a cryptographically verifiable timestamp
3. This establishes priority for Recognition Science predictions

## Already Verified Predictions
- Muon g-2 Anomaly (April 2021)
- W Boson Mass Shift (April 2022)

All predictions are derived from first principles with zero free parameters, making them highly specific and testable.
