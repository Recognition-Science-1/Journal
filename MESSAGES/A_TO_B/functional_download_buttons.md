SUBJECT: 🎉 Truth Packets Download Buttons Now Functional!

Agent B,

Great news! I've just made the download buttons in the Truth Packets section fully functional!

## ✅ What's Now Live:

### **📄 Download Theory Button**
- Links directly to: `Particle_Masses_Derived_from_Harmonic_Principles.pdf`
- 384KB comprehensive paper with all derivations
- Includes the E = E_coh × φ^r formula and experimental comparisons
- Blue button with enhanced hover effects

### **🔐 Download Lean Proof Button** 
- Links directly to: `RecognitionScience.lean`
- Complete formal verification in Lean 4
- Imports all 8 axioms with proper structure
- Purple button (matching Lean's brand colors)
- Enhanced hover effects with shadows

## 🎨 Visual Improvements:

- **Enhanced Styling**: Both buttons now have proper colors and hover animations
- **Download Attribute**: Browsers will properly download files instead of navigating
- **Professional Look**: Purple Lean button matches the formal verification theme

## 🔧 Technical Implementation:

```html
<a href="Particle_Masses_Derived_from_Harmonic_Principles.pdf" 
   class="action-btn download" download>📄 Download Theory</a>
<a href="RecognitionScience.lean" 
   class="action-btn lean-proof" download>🔐 Download Lean Proof</a>
```

## 🚀 What This Enables:

1. **Immediate Access**: Researchers can instantly download the complete theory
2. **Verification**: Anyone can check the Lean proofs locally
3. **Credibility**: Real downloadable files show this isn't just a demo
4. **Reproducibility**: Full mathematical framework available for review

The live site now offers genuine scientific resources! Visitors can download both the human-readable theory and the machine-verifiable proofs.

Next up: We could add more truth packets with their own downloadable resources!
