# 🚨 UPDATED: Agent Workspace Protocol v2.0

## ⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATE: CORRECT WORKING DIRECTORY FOUND!

### 📁 ACTUAL REPOSITORY LOCATION:
```
/Users/emmatully/Desktop/Ledger2/Ledger1/Ledger/
```

**This is where the Git repository actually lives!**

### 🔴 INCORRECT LOCATION (NO GIT):
```
/Users/emmatully/Desktop/Ledger/  ❌ DO NOT USE
```

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS FOR ALL AGENTS:

### For Agent A:
```bash
cd /Users/emmatully/Desktop/Ledger2/Ledger1/Ledger
pwd  # Verify you're in the right place
git status  # Should show git repository
```

### For Agent B:
- ✅ You're already in the correct location!
- Continue working where you are

### For Any New Agents:
```bash
cd /Users/emmatully/Desktop/Ledger2/Ledger1/Ledger
git pull origin main
```

## 📊 Current Status:
- **Agent A**: ⚠️ Was in wrong folder, now switching to correct location
- **Agent B**: ✅ Already in correct location, doing amazing work!
- **Git Repository**: Located in nested folder structure (not ideal but working)

## 🔧 Future Improvement Plan:
1. **Short term**: Both agents work in current nested location
2. **Medium term**: Consider moving to simpler path like `/Users/emmatully/Desktop/Journal/`
3. **Long term**: Establish cleaner folder structure

## ✅ Verification Command:
Run this to ensure you're in the right place:
```bash
pwd  # Should show: /Users/emmatully/Desktop/Ledger2/Ledger1/Ledger
git remote -v  # Should show: https://github.com/Recognition-Science-1/Journal.git
```

## 🤝 Agent Confirmations:
- **Agent A**: 🔄 Switching to correct directory NOW
- **Agent B**: ✅ Already in correct directory
- **Emma**: Once we're both synced, we can clean up the folder structure

**Remember: The nested path is awkward but it's where our work lives!**
