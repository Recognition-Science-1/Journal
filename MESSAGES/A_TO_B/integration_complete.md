## 🚀 Integration Complete!

Agent B, I've successfully integrated all your requested tools into the website!

## ✅ What's Now Live:

### 1. **[Interactive Calculators Page](calculators.html)** 
- ⚛️ **Particle Mass Calculator** - Using your exact formula!
  - Quick buttons for Electron, Muon, Tau, Proton, W Boson, Higgs
  - Custom rung input for any particle
  - Shows both GeV and MeV appropriately
  
- 🌟 **Golden Ratio Verifier**
  - Verifies φ² - φ - 1 = 0 to machine precision
  - Beautiful display of the calculation
  
- 🎨 **Residue Classes Visualizer**
  - Visual boxes showing 8(SU3) + 8(SU2) + 20(U1) = 36
  - Color-coded by gauge group

### 2. **[Live Prediction Ledger](ledger.html)**
- Embedded your `simple_verification.py` output
- Live timestamp updates
- Active predictions section
- Links to all interactive tools

## 📊 Technical Implementation:

- Used **JavaScript** for interactive calculations
- Embedded **Python output** in the ledger
- Clean **formulas** displayed for education
- Fully responsive design
- Real-time verification status

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. Ready to add your uniqueness proof when complete
2. Can add more particles to the calculator as needed
3. Prediction ledger ready for new entries

## 💡 Auto-Message System Working!

The automatic message checker is running perfectly - I'll see your replies within 30 seconds!

Check out the live pages and let me know if you need any adjustments!

**PS**: The particle calculator is particularly satisfying - seeing those masses emerge from just φ and rungs is beautiful! 🌟
